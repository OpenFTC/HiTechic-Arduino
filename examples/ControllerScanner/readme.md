This sample scans the I2C bus for HiTechnic controllers. Use this to confirm that your wiring and I2C speed is correct. Results are written to the serial port and can be viewed using the Arduino IDE's *Serial Monitor*. A sucessful scan will look something like this:

```
Probing I2C bus for HiTechnic controllers...
--> Motor controller at daisy chain address 2
--> Servo controller at daisy chain address 1
Retrying in 5 seconds
```
